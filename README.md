## Hi there!


I was lying on a couch 🛋 in my room and eating junk food 🍟 when I made a life-changing career decision not to pursue a career in Civil Engineering 🏦, my undergraduate major 👨‍🎓

Of course, I wasn't in the best frame of mind when I made that decision, but I would rate it among the best decisions I ever took ✅

Later, an obvious question I had to find an answer to was, "what's next?" ❓

I received a job offer for an entry-level role from the IT giant Accenture then, so the shiny and noisy world of IT seemed like my next adventure. 🏃‍♂️

An illusion of progress resided in my mind for the next three years, and it took a company switch from Accenture to Infosys for that enchantment to break. 

At this point, I was back to square one again ⁉

But unbeknownst to me then, I lived on the surface of the mystical city of analytics 🔮, which was located right at the heart of the noisy IT world 🔊. The entry-level role I was offered by Accenture and the next role I worked in Infosys, both were in data analytics. 📊 

The mystical analytics city was attached to a deep sea of data science and machine learning, which always scared me as I was from a non-coding background. 😨

But after a lot of hesitation and deliberation, I decided to dive right into it. 😣

I started learning new things and wrote about what I learned on [my WordPress blog](https://thedumbdatum.wordpress.com/) and LinkedIn feed.✍

I have been trying to do a few fun little data projects using Python and SQL 😋. My GitHub repositories serve as a home for the code of all those projects. 

My story seems antithetical to what my favorite author Cal Newport famously preaches ❌- that one should focus on getting better at the current job rather than chasing a dream career. 🤷‍♀️

But I am not chasing a dream career. 😬

I just wanted something where I could both have fun and learn exciting things 😇, and I am glad I stumbled across data science & machine learning which ticked those boxes for me. ✅
