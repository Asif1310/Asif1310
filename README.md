### Hi there üëã

I was lying on a couch in my room and eating junk food when I made a life-changing career decision not to pursue a career in Civil Engineering, my undergraduate major.

Of course, I wasn't in the best frame of mind when I made that decision, but I would rate it among the best decisions I ever took.

Later, an obvious question I had to find an answer to was, "what's next?"

I received a job offer for an entry-level role from the IT giant Accenture then, so the shiny and noisy world of IT seemed like my next adventure.

An illusion of progress resided in my mind for the next three years, and it took a company switch from Accenture to Infosys for that enchantment to break.

At this point, I was back to square one again ‚Åâ

But unbeknownst to me then, I lived on the surface of the mystical city of analytics, which was located right at the heart of the noisy IT world. The entry-level role I was offered by Accenture and the next role I worked in Infosys, both were in data analytics. 

The mystical analytics city was attached to a deep sea of data science and machine learning, which always scared me as I was from a non-coding background.

But after a lot of hesitation and deliberation, I decided to dive right into it. 

I started learning new things and wrote about what I learned on [my WordPress blog](https://thedumbdatum.wordpress.com/) and LinkedIn feed.

I have been trying to do a few fun little projects using Python and SQL. My GitHub repositories serve as a home for the code of all those projects.

My story seems antithetical to what my favorite author Cal Newport famously preaches - that one should focus on getting better at the current job rather than chasing a dream career.

But I am not chasing a dream career. 

I just wanted something where I could both have fun and learn exciting things, and I am glad I stumbled across data science & machine learning which ticked those boxes for me.
